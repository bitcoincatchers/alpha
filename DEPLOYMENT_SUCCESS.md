# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS: Entry MCAP Fix

## 📅 Deployment Date: August 29, 2025
## 👨‍💻 Developer: Claude AI Assistant  
## 📦 Repository: https://github.com/bitcoincatchers/alpha

## 🎯 CRITICAL BUG FIXED

### **THE PROBLEM** ❌
- Entry MCAP was always displaying as the same value as Current MCAP
- This made P&L calculations completely wrong
- Sell orders couldn't be placed correctly after buys
- Users couldn't track real trading performance

### **THE SOLUTION** ✅  
- **Database Enhancement**: Added `entry_mcap` column to `automated_trades` table
- **Smart Data Capture**: Modified `custodial-wallet.js` to capture real market cap at purchase time
- **Intelligent Lookup**: Updated `position-manager.js` to prioritize real entry data from automated trades
- **Fixed Fallback Logic**: Eliminated fake fallback that used current mcap as entry mcap
- **API Completion**: Created missing `/api/limit-orders/create` endpoint
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added full test suite to prevent regression
